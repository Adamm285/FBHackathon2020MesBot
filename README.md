## Description


<h3>Hi, my name is Adam, allow me to introduce myself!</h3>

I do a small amount of advertising on the FB platform. I have always felt it best to keep the whole transaction on FB, even more so in the messenger app. I think it's just a trusted place where clients know they are being protected and more freely engage in transactions. I know I prefer it when FB auto-fills my information without much typing.

I am excited to be part of the FB Hackathon F8 2020. I have pushed myself to produce a complete client experience for the best subs in the world, Publix subs! On the app named, FBHackathon2020MesBot, one can chose from Publix's named subs. Next, one choses their bread, cheese and toppings. Once the order is placed, We use the device's location to send the "Sub app" to the closest store. The Bot will then be sent a message confirming that the order was received at which location with directions & an estimated wait time.

In the future, I would like to add feedback from the stores to the status of the Sub: 1) order received 2) being made and 3) ready to go. I would also display where in the store to expect the sub to be waiting. More importantly is to increase the items available for purchase, first allowing clients to add soup or a drink. Although the end plan is to be able buy anything in the store directly from messenger with minimal to zero human interaction.

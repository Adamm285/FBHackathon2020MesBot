# FBHackathon2020MesBot

<h1>Facebook Messenger Bot</h1>

<h3>Hi my name is Adam! Allow me to introduce myself,</h3>

I do a small amount of advertising on the platform on a few different fb pages. I have always felt it best to keep the whole transaction on FB, even more so in the messenger app. I think it's just a trusted place where clients know they are being protected and more freely give information. I know I prefer when it auto-fills my information without much typing. I have worked diligently with a great fb marketing expert for around 6 months and we have built "instant experiences" and "messenger ads". They are some of my best preforming ads. 

I am excited to be part of the FB Hackathon F8 2020. I have pushed myself to produce a complete client experience for the best subs in the world, Publix subs. On the app named, FBHackathon2020MesBot, one can chose from Publix or Boars Head meat, Pick a well known favorite sub, chose your bread, cheese and toppings. Once your custom sub is the way you like it, We use your location to send your "Sub app" to the closest store. You will be informed that your order was received at which location with directions and an estimated wait time.

In the future, I would like to add feedback from the store to the status of the Sub: Order received, being made and ready to go. we could also display where in the store to expect the sub to be waiting.
